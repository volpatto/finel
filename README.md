# FINEL -- A general purpose FINite ELement code

I present here my implementation of the Finite Element Method with Galerkin Approximation based on the classical book Finite Elements: An Introduction wrote by Tinsley Oden, Eric Becker and Graham Carey (such a great book!!!). Also, I inspired myself by some ideas showed in The Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis, Thomas Hughes. The code provided there (DLEARN) was a great help for me.
